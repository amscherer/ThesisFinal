    <p>Despite a nation wide ban that was enacted 45 years ago lead-based paint maintains a terrifying, often silent, unequal grip on the modern lives of Americans. While we may not be seeing advertisements for paint filled with lead, our City's children of today, and adults of tomorrow still face the lasting weight of health and developmental delays caused by chipped lead based paint. </p>
    <p>The goal of this project is to explore the disproportionate harm of LBP on  low- income New York City residents and present the findings in a wearable collection of clothing. In order to adequately represent the harm and prolonged health impacts of the exposure of LBP, each piece is designed using marbles in order to add weight to the experience of the data.</p>

    <h2>The History of Lead-Based Paint</h2>
      
    <p> Humans have a long history of lead use, that ranges as far back as the Roman Empire. As such, humans are no stranger to lead poisoning. In the 20th century, our use of lead in paint was fraught with lies and deception by the Lead Industries Association (LIA). </p>
    <p>Explore the timeline below for a better understanding of how the United States went from lead-based paint supporter to the present day abater. </p>

      If we take the past 5 complete years from the data above, there are 5 neighborhoods that consisitently find themselves ranked in the top 10 neighborhoods for lead-paint violations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those neighborhoods are: Flatbush, Washington Heights South, Bedford Park- Fordham North, East Concourse-Concourse Village, and Mount Hope.
